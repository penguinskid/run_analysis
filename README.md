This the script, readme, and codebook for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project

This readme serves to explain the necessary conditions of my script:

1) All the samsung files were in the working directory, so that they could be called just by their file name and then would be loaded into R.

2) I used the dplyr package in my script.  This requires the the dplyr package is installed before the script is run. I did not inlcude a "install.packages("dplyr") line in my code, but I did include a "library(dplyr)" line; I was told it is bad etiquette to force someone to download something from the internet if they try and run a script.

The explanation of my script and the variable names are in the codebook.md file in this same repository.  I also included a description of the code in the actual script itself.  This was useful for me, and hopefully for you as well, so I could understand and describe what my code was doing each step of the way.

Hope I explained everything well!
