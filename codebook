The project had me select only the mean() and std() features for each measurement
I interpreted this as meaning: find and select features that had "mean()" or "std()" at the end of their names.

	Note: I did not include measurements of meanFreq(); I did not think that the meanFreq was the same as the mean() 
	and std() of the measurements (I could be wrong though); I did however include the angle measurement if it had a mean()
	or std() at the end of the variable string
	
	Note2: I renamed the variables by removing parenthesis, dashes, underscores, and made the variable names one 
	continuous string; this made the variables easier to use in R and dplyr and easier to read, in my opinion.
	
	Note3: I did not do any renaming after that.  I thought that this project could be a step in a larger goal of 
	data tidying; I wanted to maintain as much of the original name as possible because of this.
	
I also added Subject and Activity variables:
	The Subjects were the people who had the phone attached to their hip
	The Activities were the activities that they were doing while the phone was collecting data - walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, 
	sitting, standing, and laying.
	
The summaries you see in my tidy data set represent taking the mean of the mean (kinda funny to read), std, angle-mean,
and angle-std of each variable over the activity - walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying - 
that the subject was performing when the signal was read.  For example, Subject 1, while Laying, had a mean tBodyAccmeanX
value of 0.221598244 units.
	It is important to note that since the original raw data was normalized, the original scientists stripped the observations 
	of the original units, whether those units be angular acceleration (radians/second^2) or gyroscopic units (whatever those are).
	As a result, my mean values do not have units either



Below is the original teams explanation of the features; I removed the unused variable estimation signals which now only reads
mean(), std(), and angle().

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
20 Hz to remove noise. 

Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 

Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
